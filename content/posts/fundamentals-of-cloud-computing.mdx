When the term _“the cloud”_ emerged in the early 2000s, it was a thing of a few. The idea of accessing computing resources from somewhere other than a traditional, on-premise IT infrastructure sounded like science fiction. Almost two decades later, we can see that the reality was much more profound back then and that cloud computing forever changed the way we run businesses.

In today’s world, cloud computing involves a gigantic market, one that continues to grow at an unparalleled scale. Massive computational power, once only reachable by large companies, is now available at the fingertips of even the smallest of businesses and individual developers, thanks to cloud computing. Moreover, cloud computing makes all this computational power highly affordable with _pay-as-you-go_ pricing offers.

By taking a look at the most prominent emerging technologies (like Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Analytics), we can see that, in order to work efficiently, all of them require huge storage space and computational power—given the massive amounts of data they deal with. Cloud computing is the only viable platform for these technologies to operate _efficiently_.

In this blog post, we explore the core concepts of cloud computing, from its fundamental characteristics to the different service and deployment models to a few success cases of cloud computing adoption.

## What is Cloud Computing?

In simple terms, cloud computing allows you to rent instead of buying your IT infrastructure. Rather than investing heavily in servers, databases, software, and hardware, companies and individuals now opt to access and consume these services via the internet—or the cloud—and pay for them as they use them. These cloud services now include but are not limited to servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and business intelligence. So, the cloud provides the speed, scalability, and flexibility that allows businesses to develop, innovate, and support business IT solutions.

From a more technical standpoint, we have the definition provided by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf), which states that:

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

As a result, cloud computing eliminates the need for enterprises to procure, configure, or manage resources themselves, and they only pay for what they use.

## Who Uses the Cloud?

Organizations of every sort, size, and market use cloud computing for a broad range of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development, software testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, Pinterest uses cloud computing to manage several petabytes of data generated by its users on a daily basis. Spotify uses the cloud to store its extensive repository of songs. And Netflix, one of the biggest video streaming platforms, uses the cloud to allow users to stream shows from anywhere in the world.
